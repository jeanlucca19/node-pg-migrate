<h2>ðŸ’» Overview </h2>

An Object Relational Mapping (ORM), as TypeORM, Prisma and Sequelize, are technologies that let you query and manipulate data usually from a database using an object-oriented paradigm.

But currently we are having the disadvantage of the __low performance to execute more complex queries using the ORM__.

With that in mind, we bring the ****`node-pg-migrate`**** library as an alternative. Which is **Database Migration Management** created exclusively for **postgres.**.
<br>

##    Scope:
Based on the library documentation, we created a simple migration of the tables: user, posts and points. And an application to perform aggregation using time scale db.
